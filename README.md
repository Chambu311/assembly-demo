2. Node.js 18+ installed

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd assembly-demo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```bash
# Pexels API Key
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key_here

# Next.js Base URL (for API calls)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
